# Project Progress

## Current state

- Product discovery is documented in `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/build-brief.md`, `docs/domain-model.md`, `docs/risks-and-open-questions.md`, and `DESIGN.md`.
- The repository contains the Kotlin Multiplatform starter scaffold: `shared`, `androidApp`, `desktopApp`, and an existing iOS target. Shared Compose UI is in `commonMain`; the iOS target is not an MVP deliverable.
- `shared/src/commonMain/.../App.kt` now contains the shared Spanish chat starting screen; answer service, land management, and official-source retrieval are not implemented.
- Shared tests include reducer coverage for the chat composer; backend and full UI behavior are deferred to later features.
- The backend now has a minimal FastAPI service with a documented liveness endpoint.
- Product features are tracked in `feature_list.json`. `backend_health` is accepted; `chat_home` is implemented and passing shared/Desktop self-verification; independent acceptance can review it, while Android verification awaits SDK configuration.

## Start and verify

- Startup/toolchain check: `./init.sh`
- Standard verification: `./init.sh --verify`
- Android build: `./init.sh --android`
- Launch Desktop: `./init.sh --desktop`

Verification evidence for `chat_home`:

- `./init.sh` passes with the restored Gradle 9.8.0 wrapper and reports the current feature state.
- `./gradlew :shared:jvmTest` passes.
- `./gradlew :desktopApp:build` passes.
- `./init.sh --verify`, `./gradlew :shared:testAndroidHostTest`, and `./init.sh --android` stop before compilation because neither `ANDROID_HOME` nor `local.properties` with `sdk.dir` is configured in this worktree. No Android result is claimed.
- Desktop launch/manual smoke was not run because it is an interactive long-running target; compilation is covered by `:desktopApp:build`.

## Next feature

Preferred next feature: `suggested_questions` — add example prompts after the accepted chat starting screen.
