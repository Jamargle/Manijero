# Manijero Durable Constraints

Operational MUST/MUST NOT rules that future features have to respect on top of
`AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and the accepted contracts.

## Answer grounding

- **MUST**: no component may emit a user-visible answer claim that has not passed
  `backend/app/generation.py::verify_draft`. A draft produced by a hosted model,
  a prompt, a cache, or any future generator must be discarded **whole** when it
  fails, never partially emitted, repaired, or replaced by model or unreviewed
  knowledge. Reason: `grounded_answer_generation` established that code — not a
  model — is the authority on whether an answer may be shown, and an
  unverified claim is exactly the failure a wrong Spanish deadline or amount
  would come from.
- **MUST**: a user-visible answer's citation markers, its `sources` array, and
  the orientative notice are owned by code (`generate_grounded_answer` /
  `to_answer_response`), never by a generator. Reason: marker `[n]` must keep
  meaning `sources[n-1]`, and the notice is a fixed orientative line, not
  generated prose.

## Client request failure

- **MUST**: a request that failed or never reached the answer service MUST NOT be rendered as an
  answer, and recovery MUST keep the exact original wording. The failure lives in
  `ChatHomeState.failure` and is shown as a separate notice — never a transcript entry, never an
  `Asistente` label — while `RetryClicked` re-sends `ChatHomeState.failedQuestion` verbatim and
  appends no second user message (`ChatConversation` classifies the thrown failure; the transport
  signals are the payload-free `AnswerServiceUnavailableException`/`AnswerServiceErrorException`).
  Reason: `network_error_recovery` established that a person must never believe an unanswered
  question was answered, and `response_states`/`answer_source_cards` will render this transcript
  next, so a retryable failure must keep the question recoverable and out of the answer stream.

## Abstention

- **MUST**: no component may emit an abstention that carries a source, a figure,
  or a date, and abstention copy is code-owned (`ABSTENTION_MESSAGES` /
  `to_abstention_response`), never generated, paraphrased, or supplied by a
  caller. An abstention payload is exactly the accepted `AskResponse` keys with
  `status: "abstained"`, `sources: []`, `land_ids_to_choose: []`, and one pinned
  plain-Spanish message with no digit and no date. Reason: the point of
  abstaining is to avoid an invented deadline or amount; leaking evidence or
  figures into the "I cannot answer" path would reintroduce exactly that failure,
  and generated abstention prose could contradict the pinned counsel to consult
  the Oficina Comarcal Agraria or the cooperative.

## Land editing

- **MUST**: editing a land MUST update exactly one stored record: it carries every attribute the
  edit form does not collect (`areaHectares`, `notes`) through unchanged, preserves the targeted
  `id` and `createdAtEpochMillis`, never calls `create`/`delete`, and MUST NOT report an update as
  saved when `update` returned `null` or threw. Reason: `edit_land` established that correcting one
  detail must never rewrite another land or silently erase stored data.
